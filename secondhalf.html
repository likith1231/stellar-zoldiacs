                        <strong>Remember Earth's magnetic field getting shaken?</strong> That creates something called "geomagnetic currents" - like invisible rivers of electricity flowing through the ground and power lines!
                    </div>
                    <p>Power companies send electricity through big metal wires on tall poles. These wires stretch across cities, states, and even countries! When space weather creates extra magnetic energy, it induces electric currents in these long power lines - kind of like how a generator works. But this is unwanted electricity that can overload transformers (those gray boxes on power poles). In 1989, a massive solar storm knocked out power for 6 million people across Quebec, Canada for 9 hours!</p>

                        <p>When the city power grid has problems, every building connected to it feels the effects. Hospitals switch to backup generators, traffic lights might go out, and water treatment plants have to use emergency power. This is where it starts affecting your neighborhood!</p>

                    <p>Cities rely on radio towers for emergency services, AM/FM radio stations for broadcasts, and satellite dishes for TV and internet. When the ionosphere gets disturbed by solar particles, these signals bounce in the wrong direction or don't bounce at all. Police radios might not work properly, GPS systems lose accuracy by several meters, and airplane pilots have trouble communicating with air traffic control towers.</p>

                    <p>Pilots flying over polar regions get exposed to more radiation during solar storms - about as much as getting several chest X-rays! So airlines reroute planes to fly at different latitudes. GPS problems mean planes need more spacing between them. And communication issues with air traffic control towers can delay hundreds of flights. In 2015, a solar storm forced airlines to reroute 150+ polar flights in a single day!</p>

                    <p>As you get older, YOU might become a scientist studying the Sun, an engineer designing better satellites, a meteorologist forecasting space weather, or an astronaut traveling through space! The technology challenges caused by space weather create opportunities for smart young people like YOU to invent solutions. Maybe you'll design a satellite that can withstand solar storms, or create better warning systems, or develop new ways to protect power grids.</p>
